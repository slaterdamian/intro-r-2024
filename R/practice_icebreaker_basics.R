#### Practice Problem: Loading and manipulating a data frame ####
# Don't forget: Comment anywhere the code isn't obvious to you!

# Load the readxl and dplyr packages

# Use the read_excel function to load the class survey data

# Take a peek!

# Create a travel_speed column in your data frame using vector operations and 
#   assignment

# Look at a summary of the new variable--seem reasonable?

# Choose a travel mode, and use a pipe to filter the data by your travel mode

# Note the frequency of the mode (# of rows returned)

# Repeat the above, but this time assign the result to a new data frame

# Look at a summary of the speed variable for just your travel mode--seem 
#   reasonable?

# Filter the data by some arbitrary time, distance, or speed threshold

# Stretch yourself: Repeat the above, but this time filter the data by two 
#   travel modes (Hint: %in%)
